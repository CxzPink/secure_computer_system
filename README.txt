1. This project uses the ECC algorithm to simulate the encryption and decryption of information between two users.

2. No input is required to run the executable.

3. If necessary, you can change the parameters of the elliptic curve and the information you want to convey in the main.cpp file. 
For example, ECC ecc(89,-1,0)ï¼Œinput="hello world".

4. However, you must be aware that changes in the ecc parameters can make the ecc performance worse or better.
